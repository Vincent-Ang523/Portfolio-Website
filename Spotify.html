								<p><h2>Objective of the Analysis</h2></p>
								<p>Spotify has seen consistent growth in both the number of premium users and number of free or ad-supported users. However, as will be shown below, premium subscribers make up a decreasing portion of active users.
									Increasing the number of premium subscribers will be key to increasing Spotify's revenue and therefore, increase its profitability. This analysis aims to provide insights about the differences between premium users and free users in their Spotify usage.
									This insight can be used to guide Spotify's app development strategy and marketing strategy to entice free users to subscribe to Spotify Premium.</p>
								<p><h2>Summary of Insights</h2></p>
								<p>The analysis for the project was done in excel with the visualizations done in tableau.</p>
								<p>The sources for the analysis come from <a href = "https://investors.spotify.com/financials/default.aspx#quarterly-results" target="_blank">Spotify's quarterly result</a> and the <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meeraajayakumar/spotify-user-behavior-dataset" target="_blank">Spotify User Behavior Dataset</a>.</p>
								
								<p><h3>User Number Data</h3></p>
								<span class="image fit">

								</span>
								<p><h5 align = "right">Source: Spotify</h5></p>
								<p>Spotify's user number saw consistent growth from 2017 to 2024. However, the share of premium users notably declined from 45% in 2019 to 38% in 2024. It can also be seen that premium subscribers make up the minority of users throughout the recorded time period</p>

								<p><h3>Who uses Spotify?</h3></p>
								<span class="image fit">
									<img src = "images/Spotify Demographic Data.png">
								</span>
								<p><h5 align = "right">Source: Spotify User Behavior Dataset</h5></p>
								<p>Outlined below are key takeaways derived from the above dashboard:</p>
								<p><ul>
									<li>The age demographic for both premium and free users are similar with the 20-35 year old range making up the largest proportion in both groups.</li>
									<li>The majority of users are female for both free and premium users.</li>
									<li>Spotify free users tend to have used Spotify for a shorter period of time. A much higher proportion of free users have used Spotify for less than 6 months compared to premium users. Meanwhile a higher proportion of premium users have used Spotify for 1 year or more.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								
								<p><h3>Where do people listen to Spotify?</h3></p>
								<span class="image fit">
									<img src = "images/Spotify Device Data.png">
								</span>
								<p><h5 align = "right">Source: Spotify User Behavior Dataset</h5></p>
								<p>A much higher proportion of free users primarily use smartphones to listen to Spotify compared to premium users. Meanwhile, those who listen on multiple devices make up the largest portion for premium users.</p>
								</span>
								
								<p><h3>When do users listen to Spotify?</h3></p>
								<span class="image fit">
									<img src = "images/Spotify Listening Time Data.png">
								</span>
								<p><h5 align = "right">Source: Spotify User Behavior Dataset</h5></p>
								<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
								<p><ul>
									<li>For both free and premium users, night time seems to be the time of day with the most activity. However, a much higher proportion of free users listen to Spotify at night. Meanwhile, morning sees the least activity for both user categories.</li>
									<li>The largest proportion of both free and premium users listen to Spotify on multiple occasions making up roughly 48% for both groups. However, a higher proportion of free users listen to Spotify during leisure time with almost 19% of users compared to 7% for premium users.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<p><h3>What do users listen to?</h3></p>
								<span class="image fit">
									<img src = "images/Listening Preference Data.png">
								</span>
								<p><h5 align = "right">Source: Spotify User Behavior Dataset</h5></p>
								<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
								<p><ul>
									<li>The majority of users listen to music instead of podcasts in both user categories.</li>
									<li>The majority of free users listen to the melody music genre making up 54% compared to 29% for premium users. Free users are also much less likely to listen to classical music and rap.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<p><h3>How do users discover music?</h3></p>
								<span class="image fit">
									<img src = "images/Music Discovery Data.png">
								</span>
								<p><h5 align = "right">Source: Spotify User Behavior Dataset</h5></p>
								<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
								<p><ul>
									<li>On average, Spotify free users rate Spotify's recommendation system more highly than premium users</li>
									<li>The largest number of both free and premium users discover music using multiple methods. However, free users are more likely to use Spotify recommendations and Spotify playlists to discover music.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								</span>
							    <p><h2>Recommendations</h2></p>
								<p>
									Based on the analysis, here are some actions that could be taken to convert more free users to Spotify premium:
								<ol>
									<li>Since free users tend to have used Spotify for a shorter period of time, they may not be as experienced with the app interface and the benefits of Spotify premium. One way to entice free users is the implementation of free trials for Spotify premium. By being able to experience the benefits of Spotify Premium at no cost, free users may be 
										enticed to extend their premium membership and become annual premium subscribers.
									</li>
									<li>
										Since most free users primarily listen to Spotify on phones, Spotify could prioritize app development on the smartphone by improving the user interface. A further investigation could also be conducted on why free users are far less likely to listen on multiple devices.
									</li>
									<li>
										Promote content that could be more fitting to listen to at night. However, more investigation may be needed to understand what content should be recommended for users at night time.
									</li>
									<li>
										Both free and premium users are most likely to listen to Spotify on multiple occasions. As such, promoting Spotify as a streaming service with wide variety of content for all occasions could entice free users and keep premium users on the service. By promoting content variety, Spotify could 
										give itself the image that it is the streaming service for all occasions, whether travelling or relaxing at home.
									</li>
									<li>
										Since most users prefer to listen to music, Spotify should focus promotions based on its music category. It should also enchance its recommendations systems to focus on musical content. However, more analysis is required to determine this strategy's effects on profitability as well as investigating the reason for lower podcast interests.
									</li>
									<li>
										Since most free users listen to melody, Spotify's recommendation system could be used to prioritize recommendations of melody content to free users. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Since a lot of free users discover music through playlists and recommendations, Spotify should focus development on its recommendations system as well as promoting more playlists made by other users.
									</li>
								</ol>
								</p>
								<p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p>
								<p>In conclusion, this analysis leveraged excel tools for data cleaning and analysis and tableau for visualization to provide insights that would help improve Spotify's profitability. 
									By comparing the behaviors of both premium and free users and understanding their differences, Spotify could tailor app development and marketing strategies to entice free users to subscribe to Spotify premium.
									Through this, Spotify could cater to the needs of both free and premium users, enchance the user experience, and solidify Spotify as the world's leading audio streaming service.
